### Biblical Principles

The Bible says: "For by grace ye are saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God" ~ Ephesians 2:8 KJV

### What does this mean to us?

We believe that the cornerstone of being a Christian is faith. We not not believe that works, or donations, or any earthy thing can be a substitution for faith.
