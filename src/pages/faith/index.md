### Biblical Principles
The Bible says: "For by grace ye are saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God" ~ Ephesians 2:8 KJV

Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever degree available.
